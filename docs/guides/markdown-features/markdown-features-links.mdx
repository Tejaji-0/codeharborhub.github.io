# Markdown Links

In CodeHarborHub, Markdown supports flexible ways of linking between documents, tutorials, and resources.

There are two main approaches:

- Using a **URL path**
- Using a **file path**

```md
- [URL path to another document](../../installation)
- [file path to another document](../../installation.mdx)
```

## URL Path Links

URL paths are unprocessed by Docusaurus. They render directly to HTML, like:

```html
<a href="./installation">Link</a>
```

This means they resolve according to the page's **URL location**, not the file system path.

## File Path Links

When you want to reference another Markdown file managed by the same plugin, use the relative **file path**.  
Docusaurus will convert the file path into the correct URL path, removing `.md` or `.mdx` extensions automatically.

For example, if your file structure is:

```
docs/folder/doc1.md
docs/folder/doc2.mdx
docs/folder/subfolder/doc3.mdx
docs/otherFolder/doc4.mdx
```

From `doc1.md`, you can write:

```md title="docs/folder/doc1.md"
I am referencing a [document](doc2.mdx).

Reference to another [document in a subfolder](subfolder/doc3.mdx).

[Relative document](../otherFolder/doc4.mdx) referencing works as well.
```

### How File Paths Resolve

Assume the current file is `website/docs/category/source.mdx`:

- `[link](./target.mdx)` → resolves from `website/docs/category`
- `[link](../target.mdx)` → resolves from `website/docs`
- `[link](/target.mdx)` → resolves from the docs content root (`website/docs`)
- `[link](target.mdx)` → checked in `website/docs/category`, then `docs` root, then site root

### Absolute File Paths

You can also reference the site directory, but be careful:

- `[link](/docs/target.mdx)` → resolved from site root `website` (⚠️ less portable)
- `[link](@site/docs/target.mdx)` → relative to site root `website` (⚠️ less portable)

## Benefits of File Path Links

Using relative **file paths** instead of raw URL links provides key benefits:

* Links work directly on GitHub and Markdown editors  
* You can change a doc's slug without breaking links  
* Editors can track file movements and update links automatically  
* Versioned docs always link to the correct version  
* Resistant to config changes (like `trailingSlash`)

## Limitation

:::warning
Markdown file references only work if the **source and target files are managed by the same plugin**.  
For example, linking a doc from a blog post requires **URL links**, not file paths.
