# Create a Doc

To create your first documentation page in **CodeHarborHub**, simply add a new Markdown file inside the `docs` directory.  
For example, create a file called **`greeting.md`**:

```bash
website   # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── src
│   └── pages
├── docusaurus.config.js
├── ...
```

Inside `greeting.md`, you can write rich Markdown content with headers, lists, and code blocks:

```md title="docs/greeting.md"
---
description: Create a doc page with rich content.
---

# Hello from CodeHarborHub

Welcome to your first **CodeHarborHub Doc Page**! 🎉

## Headers

Headers automatically appear in the **table of contents (TOC)** on the right.

## Only h2 and h3 are included by default

You can configure TOC heading levels globally or per document.

- Use bullet lists to highlight key points
- Provide step-by-step instructions
  - Nest lists for more structured content
```

## ⚡ Doc Front Matter {#doc-front-matter}

The [front matter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#front-matter)
adds metadata to your doc. It’s optional, but useful for features like tags or custom URLs.
For all available fields, see the [Docs Plugin API](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.mdx#markdown-front-matter).

Example with tags:

```md title="docs/my-doc.md"
---
tags:
  - GettingStarted
  - CodeHarborHub
---

# My First Doc
Content goes here.
```

You can also maintain predefined tags in a `tags.yml` file:

```yml title="docs/tags.yml"
CodeHarborHub:
  label: 'CodeHarborHub'
  permalink: '/codeharborhub'
  description: 'Docs related to the CodeHarborHub platform'
```

## 📁 Organizing Folder Structure {#organizing-folder-structure}

Your docs folder layout affects document IDs and URLs, but you can override defaults with front matter.

### Document ID {#document-id}

Each document has a unique `id`, derived from its file path:

```bash
website
└── docs
   ├── greeting.md        # id: greeting
   └── guide
      └── hello.md        # id: guide/hello
```

You can override the `id` in front matter:

```md title="docs/guide/hello.md"
---
id: part1
---

Content for Part 1
```

This `id` is used when referencing docs in **sidebars**, **links**, or **components**.

### Doc URLs {#doc-urls}

The default URL is based on the `id` and file path:

* `greeting.md` → `/docs/greeting`
* `guide/hello.md` → `/docs/guide/hello`

Special file names like `index`, `README`, or a name matching its parent folder
will produce a cleaner URL without the file name.

Use the `slug` front matter to override URLs:

```md
---
slug: /bonjour
---

This doc will be served at `/docs/bonjour`
```

<AdsComponent />

### Root-Level Docs {#root-docs}

To make a doc available at the **site root** (e.g., `https://example.com/`):

```md
---
id: home
slug: /
---

Welcome to the CodeHarborHub Documentation!
```

---

### 🗂 Sidebars {#sidebars}

If you use [autogenerated sidebars](./sidebar/autogenerated.mdx),
your folder structure determines the sidebar hierarchy.

**Recommended practice:**
Mirror your folder layout to your desired sidebar structure,
and use the `slug` front matter to customize URLs as needed.
