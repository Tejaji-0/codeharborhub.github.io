WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is designed to be a more efficient and real-time alternative to traditional HTTP polling mechanisms for web applications.

### Introduction:
In WebSocket, web applications typically used HTTP for communication between the client (browser) and the server. HTTP, however, is a request-response protocol, which means the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the requested data. This model is not suitable for scenarios where real-time, bidirectional communication is required because:

1. **Polling:** Clients need to continuously poll the server for updates, which can be inefficient and result in latency.
   
2. **Long-polling:** This involves keeping connections open until data is available, which can be resource-intensive.

WebSocket addresses these limitations by establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing both parties to initiate data exchange at any time, asynchronously. This connection is established through an initial handshake between the client and the server during which the protocol details are negotiated.

### Explanation:
WebSocket operates on top of TCP and provides a full-duplex communication channel between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. Here's how it works:

1. **Handshake:** The client and server establish a WebSocket connection through a handshake mechanism. The client sends an HTTP request with specific headers indicating its intent to upgrade to WebSocket. If the server supports WebSocket and agrees to the upgrade, it responds with an HTTP 101 status code (Switching Protocols) and WebSocket-specific headers.

2. **Full-Duplex Communication:** Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send messages to each other at any time without waiting for a response. This allows for real-time data exchange, such as instant messaging, live updates, multiplayer gaming, and collaborative editing.

3. **Efficiency:** WebSocket reduces latency and overhead compared to traditional HTTP-based approaches like long-polling or repeated short-polling. It maintains a single TCP connection for multiple messages, reducing the overhead of connection setup and teardown.

4. **Security:** WebSocket connections can be secured using the same protocols (TLS/SSL) used for HTTPS, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

5. **Compatibility:** WebSocket is supported by all modern web browsers and is widely used in web applications that require real-time communication.

### Use Cases:
WebSocket is particularly useful in applications requiring real-time updates or interaction, such as:

- **Chat applications:** Enables instant messaging and group chats.
- **Live sports updates:** Provides real-time score updates and commentary.
- **Collaborative editing:** Allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously.
- **Financial trading platforms:** Provides real-time market data and trading updates.
