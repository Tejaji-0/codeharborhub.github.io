This diagram explains how **CodeHarborHub‚Äôs documentation system** (powered by Docusaurus) works under the hood to build and serve your learning platform. Each **plugin** is responsible for collecting and processing content (like docs, tutorials, or blogs) and emitting structured JSON data.  

The **themes** provide the layout and UI components that transform this JSON data into dynamic, interactive web pages.

The **bundler** then takes care of packaging everything‚Äîbuilding both the **server** and **client** bundles that power the entire site experience.

## Key Architectural Layers

### 1. Plugin Layer

Plugins manage content and configuration. Each plugin runs entirely in **Node.js**, processing Markdown, MDX, and metadata into structured JSON.  

For example:
- The **Docs Plugin** gathers all your course and guide files.  
- The **Blog Plugin** handles educational blog content.  
- The **Pages Plugin** renders custom pages like `/about`, `/events`, or `/community`.

All plugin lifecycle methods run in **Node**. That means plugin code must be written in **CommonJS** (using `require`) or **ES Modules** (using `import/export`) that Node can execute.

### 2. Theme Layer

Themes define how the content looks and feels. Theme components are written in **React**, built with **Webpack**, and rendered on the client side.  

They receive the JSON output from plugins and render them as complete pages‚Äî  
such as documentation layouts, course cards, contributor profiles, and interactive learning modules.

**Themes and plugins don‚Äôt directly import or depend on each other.**  
They communicate through **JSON data** and **route configuration**, ensuring modularity and scalability.

A useful way to think about it:
> Imagine plugins are written in another language (like Rust or Go) ‚Äî they just output structured data.  
> The theme is the visual layer that interprets and displays that data beautifully.

### 3. Configuration Layer

Your `docusaurus.config.js` (or `docusaurus.config.mjs`) connects everything.

It runs in **Node.js** and defines:
- Global settings like `title`, `url`, `baseUrl`, and `favicon`
- Plugin and theme configurations
- Site metadata, SEO tags, and integration settings

You can pass callbacks or dynamic logic to plugins here.  
However, only **serializable values** (those that survive `JSON.stringify()`) make it to the client.

This means:
- ‚úÖ Strings, numbers, arrays, and objects are preserved  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Functions, regexes, and complex data structures are lost in the browser bundle

During bundling, the configuration file is serialized and injected into the client bundle, allowing the site to access global data via:

```js
import { useDocusaurusContext } from '@docusaurus/core';

const { siteConfig } = useDocusaurusContext();
console.log(siteConfig.themeConfig);
```

## Summary of the Build Process

| Stage | Environment | Responsibility |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Plugins** | Node.js | Collect content and generate JSON data |
| **Themes** | Browser + Webpack | Render JSON data into UI components |
| **Bundler** | Build (Webpack/Vite) | Output optimized server and client bundles |
| **Config** | Node.js | Define site structure and plugin options |

## Why This Matters for CodeHarborHub

This architecture allows CodeHarborHub to be:
- ‚ö° **Fast and modular** ‚Äî each content type (Docs, Blogs, Events) acts independently  
- üß† **Extensible** ‚Äî easily add new learning modules or plugins  
- üåê **Universal** ‚Äî supports versioning, localization, and custom themes  
- üîí **Safe and scalable** ‚Äî clean separation between content, configuration, and rendering
