## What is CSS

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML. It can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

## Why CSS is used

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. It allows you to separate the content of your web pages from their design and layout, making it easier to update and maintain your website.

CSS is used to style the visual presentation of web pages, including the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It allows you to create a consistent look and feel across your website, making it easier for users to navigate and understand your content.

## How CSS works

CSS works by selecting elements in an HTML document and applying styles to them. You can apply styles to elements based on their tag name, class, ID, or other attributes. You can also apply styles to elements based on their position in the document, their relationship to other elements, or their state (e.g., hover, active, visited).

CSS styles are applied in a cascading manner, meaning that styles are inherited from parent elements and can be overridden by child elements. Styles can also be applied conditionally, based on media queries, user preferences, or other factors.

CSS is a powerful and flexible language that allows you to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. It is an essential tool for web developers and designers, and it is used by millions of websites around the world.

## For example

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="html" label="index.html">
       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
       <head>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">
           <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>What is CSS</title>
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
       </head>
       <body>
           <h1>Welcome to CSS</h1>
           <p>This is an example of how CSS can be used to style web pages.</p>
       </body>
       </html>
       ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="css" label="styles.css">
       ```css
       h1 {
           color: blue;
           font-size: 24px;
       }
       
       p {
           color: green;
           font-size: 16px;
       }
       
       ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, we have an HTML document that contains a heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`). We have also linked a CSS file to the HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.

Now, you can see the output of the above code in the Browser Window like this:

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html" bodyStyle={{fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif", backgroundColor: "#f9f9f9"}}>
       <>
        <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '24px' }}>Welcome to CSS</h1>
        <p style={{ color: 'green', fontSize: '16px' }}>This is an example of how CSS can be used to style web pages.</p>
       </>
</BrowserWindow>
      
In this example, we have applied styles to the heading and paragraph elements using CSS. The heading is styled with a blue color and a font size of 24 pixels, while the paragraph is styled with a green color and a font size of 16 pixels.
