}
```

- `selector`: The element to which the color is applied.
- `color`: The CSS property used to set the color of the text.
- `color-name`: The predefined name of the color.
- The color name is used to specify the color of the text, background, border, or other CSS properties.

```css title="index.css"
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

In the HTML code below, the CSS rule will set the color of the `<h1>` element to red:

```html title="index.html"
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

### Example: Using Color Names

In the following example, the color name `blue` is used to set the color of the text to blue:

<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="HTML" label="index.html">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Color Names Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Color Names</h1>
  <p>This is an example of using color names in CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
</TabItem >
 <TabItem value="CSS" label="styles.css">
```css title="styles.css"
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: darkred;
}
```

</TabItem >
</Tabs>

Now, you can see the output of the above code in the Browser Window like this:

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html" bodyStyle={{ backgroundColor: "#f9f9f9", color: "#000" }}>
    <div>
        <h1 style={{ color: "blue" }}>Welcome to Color Names</h1>
        <p style={{ color: "darkred" }}>This is an example of using color names in CSS.</p>
    </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In this example, the color names `blue` and `darkred` are used to set the color of the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements, respectively. The `<h1>` element will have blue text, while the `<p>` element will have dark red text.

Color names are a convenient way to specify colors in CSS and can be used to create visually appealing designs in web development projects.
