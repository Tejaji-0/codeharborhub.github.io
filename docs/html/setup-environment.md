1. Create a new file by clicking `File` &rarr; `New File`.
2. Save it with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
3. Write your HTML code. For example:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>

  </body>
</html>
```

4. To see your work in action, right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server". Your default web browser should open and display your HTML page. `http://localhost:5500/index.html` will be the URL.

   <BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:5500/index.html">
