## Audio Attributes and Controls

### Audio Attributes

The `<audio>` element in HTML allows you to embed audio content in your web pages. It supports various attributes that you can use to customize the appearance and behavior of the audio player. Here are some common attributes used with the `<audio>` element:

| Attribute      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src`          | Specifies the URL of the audio file to be played.                           |
| `controls`     | Adds audio controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.        |
| `autoplay`     | Automatically starts playing the audio when the page loads.                 |
| `loop`         | Specifies whether the audio should start over again when it reaches the end.|
| `preload`      | Specifies how the audio file should be loaded when the page loads.          |
| `muted`        | Specifies whether the audio should be muted by default.                     |
| `volume`       | Specifies the volume level of the audio player (0.0 to 1.0).                |

### Example: Adding Audio Attributes

Here's an example of how you can use the `<audio>` element with various attributes to embed audio content in your HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Audio Player</title>
</head>
<body>
  <audio src="audio.mp3" controls autoplay loop preload="auto" muted volume="0.5">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <audio src="/audio/audio.mp3" controls autoplay loop preload="auto" muted volume="0.5">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, we have used the `<audio>` element with various attributes such as `src`, `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `preload`, `muted`, and `volume` to customize the appearance and behavior of the audio player.

## Adding Audio and Video with Multiple Sources

You can provide multiple sources for audio and video files using the `<source>` element. This allows the browser to choose the best source based on its compatibility. Here's an example of how you can provide multiple sources for audio and video files:

### Example: Adding Multiple Sources for Audio and Video

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Audio and Video Player</title>
</head>
<body>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>

  <video controls width="640" height="360">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video element.
  </video>
</body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="/audio/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    <source src="/audio/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>

  <video controls className="w-full h-auto">
    <source src="/video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <source src="/video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
    Your browser does not support the video element.
  </video>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, we have used the `<source>` element to provide multiple sources for audio and video files. The browser will choose the best source based on its compatibility with the user's device and browser. This ensures that the audio and video content can be played on a wide range of devices and browsers.
